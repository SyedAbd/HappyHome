## Client Reporting

\-

## Daily Scrum Plan

Every Monday at 10AM once everyone has made it to the office the Sprint Planning starts. Hours can change in case people are late or cannot make it although we wouldn’t allow that gap to be too big. If member(s) cannot make it to the meeting, given appropriate circumstances and reasons, it will be held remotely as well. The only exceptions are public holidays in which the workload is adjusted, and prior planning is done. Upon discussion the team has agreed to have one week long sprints. Every morning we have quick checkups with the team to make sure everyone is doing well and is on track. The Sprint Review & Retro are done on Fridays starting between 2 to 3 PM, depending on the team’s schedule, as Fridays tend to be shorter days for most. During the review period we will go over the things that got done the past week and talk through the good and bad of both the development and the experience that the team had. There will be documentation made for both the Sprint Planning and Sprint Reviews where notes are taken in order to improve future Sprints. The techniques that we plan on using currently are the 4Ls, Mad/Sad/Glad and Start/Stop/Continue. 

## Communication Channels

Discord, Teams.

## Documentation

The project will have a Game Design Document (GDD), that will be updated throughout the development process.
Other documentation, such as a Project Plan and a Business Plan will be created as they are required by the course administration.

### Documentation Templates

The documents will use templates provided by JAMK or members of the group.

### Document Control

The documentation will not have version numbering, but an attempt will be made to preserve backup versions of created documentation and their older versions.

## Risk Management

| Risks                                                  | Probability | Impact | Prevention                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| Employees get sick | High       | Big    | Every employee has some supporting role(s), so they can help the absent employee with their work |


## To Be Determined

* More defined documentation
* Additional features
